### SWEEPKEY ###

SweepKey takes a private key and sends all funds to another address. 

Demo: https://coinables.github.io/sweepkey

Background:
I was looking for a web app that would allow me to quickly paste in a private key 
and send all funds to a new address without having to sign up with a wallet provider. 
The closest thing I could find was coinb.in. Coinb.in works great, but there are multiple 
steps required. So I created SweepKey to solve this minor problem I was having. 

Usage:
Enter a private key, enter a destination address click send. Done.

sweepkey.org


This can be a very dangerous tool. If you enter the wrong destination address your funds are gone. 
Take appropriate care and attention while engaging in financial transactions.
